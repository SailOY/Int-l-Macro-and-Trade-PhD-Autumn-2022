Your report should summarize the working paper's primary contribution in one paragraph.
Proceed to offer criticisms and suggestions.
Make three or four main points, devoting a paragraph to each, that constitute advice for the authors (and insight for the editor).
Conclude the report with a list of smaller comments.
It's fine to be critical, but also offer realistic suggestions for improvement.

You may find it interesting to read Berk, Harvey, and Hirshleifer's "[Preparing a Referee Report: Guidelines and Perspectives](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2547191)",
although many of the issues discussed therein are not crucial to writing a report solely for class purposes.

## Rewriting an abstract

Select an article from the *Journal of International Economics* published in 2020-2022.
Rewrite the abstract, limiting yourself to 100 words, as discussed in class.
