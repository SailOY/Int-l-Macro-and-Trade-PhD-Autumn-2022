Please answer each of the following questions.

### Factor prices

Consider the 2x2x2 Heckscher-Ohlin model discussed in class. 
Using the concept of the integrated equilibrium,
carefully explain why there is only
factor price equalization in the trade equilibrium if both countries' factor endowments are not too dissimilar.

Read Rossi's "[The Relative Efficiency of Skilled Labor across Countries: Measurement and Interpretation](http://www.federico-rossi.com/uploads/7/7/3/5/77352113/skillprod.pdf)" (*AER*, forthcoming).
Discuss the scope for the factor-proportions theory of trade to explain the facts documented in that paper.
Can factor-price equalization explain the phenomenon under investigation?
Does this explanatory power depend on how you define goods and/or factors?

### Identifying the commuting elasticity

Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, and Wolf (Ecma 2015) report two collections of estimates of &nu;=&kappa;&epsilon;.
Table III reports four gravity-based estimates, which range from 0.0697 to 0.0771.
Table V reports three GMM-based estimates, which from 0.0951 to 0.1011.
Describe the relationship between these two sets of estimates:
- How are the gravity- and GMM-based estimates obtained?
- Under what conditions do they differ and under what conditions do they coincide?
- Which estimate should be preferred by the reader/researcher?

### Regional convergence

[Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261816) use the neoclassical growth model as a framework to study convergence across the 48 contiguous U.S. states. They find slow convergence. In light of Ventura (1997) and Acemoglu and Ventura (2002), explain why this interpretation may be problematic. Suggest alternative reasons why regional convergence may be slow.
